1. What is the title of the paper?

Avoiding Pitfalls  W hen Using  Machine Learning in HCI Studies

2. What are some common use cases for machine learning in practical applications or research prototypes?

- to model human behavior
- develop novel user-interface techniques, such as to react to user input (e.g., gesture recognition), optimize system resources (e.g., smartphone battery conservation [1]), or provide intelligent mobile notifications [2].


3. Which problems of machine learning do the authors of the paper identify? Explain one of them in detail.


- Classification accuracy is not hypothesis testing
- Causality versus correlation
- Controlled versus non-controlled experiments. 


4. What are the credentials of the authors with regard to machine learning? Have they published research on machine learning(or using machine-learning techniques) previously

- We argue that in addition to accuracy, researchers should also report baseline performance.Consider a system that attempts to

- Furthermore, especially in behavioral studies, it is important to note that the baseline is a function of both the possible outcomes and the relative likelihood of each

- Finally, it is worth noting that accuracy is not sufficient to evaluate ML classification algorithms. 

- For these reasons, we argue that a solid background in the basics of ML is necessary before adopting these tools in our research work and practice.

- Finally, we also believe that qualitative methods must play a fundamental role in interpreting quantitative data obtained by means of quantitative methods such as the application of ML techniques.

- Moreover, often ML techniques are applied to subsets of the data and, herefore, the resulting models capture only a limited part of the phenomena under observation.
