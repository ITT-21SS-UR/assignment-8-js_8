Title of the paper: 

    "Avoiding Pitfalls When Using Machine Learning in HCI Studies"

2. What are some common use cases for machine learning in practical applications or research prototypes?

The modeling of human behavior is considered as a use case for the use of machine learning techniques. 
Moreover, the optimization and development of new types of user interface technologies is another area of application. 
Machine learning can here contribute to a wide variety of research projects. For example, how to reduce the battery consumption of a smartphone, 
the intelligent provision of mobile notifications or gesture recognition.

In addition, the topic of being able to predict how potential users will interact with the system or 
what activities will be carried out is an interesting research area. A milestone here is the development 
of systems that should anticipate possible actions.

3. Which problems of machine learning do the authors of the paper identify? Explain one of them in detail.

The author of the paper identify the following problems:
    
    - Classification accuracy is not hypothesis testing
    - Causality versus correlation
    - Controlled versus non-controlled experiments. 
    
The problem lies in the accuracy of a machine learning prediction, especially when it comes to analyzing human behavior. 
In this case, machine learning methods cannot replace proven methods such as hypothesis testing and correlation/cause analyzes. 
In interpreting their results, researchers must pay immense attention to how identified behavioral traits relate to users' actual emotions.
    
    4. What are the credentials of the authors with regard to machine learning? Have they published research on machine learning(or using machine-learning techniques) previously

- We argue that in addition to accuracy, researchers should also report baseline performance.Consider a system that attempts to

- Furthermore, especially in behavioral studies, it is important to note that the baseline is a function of both the possible outcomes and the relative likelihood of each

- Finally, it is worth noting that accuracy is not sufficient to evaluate ML classification algorithms. 

- For these reasons, we argue that a solid background in the basics of ML is necessary before adopting these tools in our research work and practice.

- Finally, we also believe that qualitative methods must play a fundamental role in interpreting quantitative data obtained by means of quantitative methods such as the application of ML techniques.

- Moreover, often ML techniques are applied to subsets of the data and, herefore, the resulting models capture only a limited part of the phenomena under observation.

Yes, they have published previously research (authors: Vassilis Kostakos & Mirco Musolesi).
